Essay : Some people believe that learning practical skills is more important than academic knowledge. To what extent do you agree or disagree?

Many individuals argue that knowledge acquired through action is significant rather than theoritical knowledge. Indeed, I firmly agree this view because 
practical skills not only enhances employability in competitive job market, but also equip for real-challenges in life. This essay will examine these two reasons and conclude with my opinion. 

One main reason I agree with this view is that practical skills enable individuals to handle real-life problems and situations effectively. While academic knowledge often emphasizes theory and memorization, practical skills such as problem-solving, communication and, technical expertise can be immediately applied in professional and everyday contexts. Gaining hands-on experience allows people to adapt to unforeseen circumtances, make informed decisions and, and navigate complex situations with confidence. For instance, a software developer who gains coding experience through internships and live projects is better equipped to resolve real programming challenges than someone who only relies on classroom-based learning. 

Another reason I strongly support this view is that practical skills significantly improve employement prospects and career advancement. Modern companies increasingly prefer candidates who demonstrate tangible abilities rather than just possessing academic credentials. Individuals with hands-on experience tend to perform more effeciently, contribute effeciently to organizational works, and often progress faster in their careers. For example, vocational training in areas such as digital marketing, data science, generative ai, or carpentry allows student to enter the workforce early and achieve promotions sooner than peers who have only completed traditional univeristy degrees. 

In conclusion, I strongly advocate the importance of practical skills over purely academic knowledge. They equip individuals to face real-world challange competently and provide a clear advantage in terms of employability and career growth.

Many individuals argue that knowledge gained through practical experience is more valuable than purely theoretical knowledge. I firmly agree with this view because practical skills not only enhance employability in a competitive job market but also prepare individuals to tackle real-life challenges. This essay will examine these two reasons and conclude with my opinion.

One main reason I support this view is that practical skills enable individuals to handle real-life problems effectively. While academic knowledge often emphasizes theory and memorization, practical skills—such as problem-solving, communication, and technical expertise—can be applied immediately in both professional and everyday contexts. Gaining hands-on experience allows people to adapt to unforeseen circumstances, make informed decisions, and navigate complex situations with confidence. For instance, a software developer who gains coding experience through internships and live projects is better equipped to resolve real programming challenges than someone who relies solely on classroom-based learning.

Another reason I endorse this perspective is that practical skills significantly improve employment prospects and career advancement. Modern companies increasingly value candidates who demonstrate tangible abilities rather than just academic credentials. Individuals with hands-on experience tend to perform more efficiently, contribute meaningfully to organizational goals, and often progress faster in their careers. For example, vocational training in areas such as digital marketing, data science, generative AI, or carpentry allows students to enter the workforce early and achieve promotions sooner than peers who have only completed traditional university degrees.

In conclusion, I strongly advocate the importance of practical skills over purely academic knowledge. They equip individuals to face real-world challenges competently and provide a distinct advantage in terms of employability and career growth.
