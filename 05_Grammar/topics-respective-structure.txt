2. Modal Verbs 

| Modal | Meaning in this sentence              | Example                                                          |
| ----- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| may   | Possible outcome, polite/formal       | “This policy **may** reduce traffic.”                            |
| might | Slightly less formal possibility      | “This policy **might** reduce traffic.”                          |
| could | Potential / hypothetical / capability | “This policy **could** reduce traffic if implemented correctly.” |
| must  | Strong certainty / deduction          | “This policy **must** reduce traffic if enforced properly.”      |


- may/might/could are all fine for expressing possibility or prediction, just vary them to show range.

    Use of can :

This policy can reduce traffic if people follow it correctly.

 - Using can often needs a condition to show it’s achievable, while may naturally expresses possibility.
