Speaking Part 2 - Cue Cards 
1 minute to prepare - 2 minutes to talk 

Struture -      Main Topic 
                You should say: 
                i. Bullet point 1 
                ii. Bullet point 2 
                iii. Bullet point 3 
                iv. Bullet point 4

Example : Describe an interesting movie you watched recently. 

        You should say: 

        i. What genre the movie was 
        ii. When you saw the movie 
        iii. What was the movie about and 
        iv. Explain why you found the movie interesting

Reason of failure: 
1. Run out of ideas and things to say 
2. Get stuck on one or more of the bullet points 

* You don't have to speak about all four bullet points. You can speak about them if you want to. But you are not obliged to say. 
* They are designed to help 
* However, most students believe that they must speak about all the points


Strategy : 

Avoid anything that prevents, such as: 
* Forcing yourself to talk about the point you don't know how to talk about 
* Trying to speak about each bullet point for an equal length of time 
* Using Strategy such as 'ppf' which might lead to uncoherence while answering the question

**Question:** *Describe a book you like.*

**Answer (using template):**
*“Well, there are a lot of books I’ve read recently, but the one that really stands out to me is *Game of Thrones* by George R. R. Martin. I remember it because it’s so detailed and full of unexpected twists.*
