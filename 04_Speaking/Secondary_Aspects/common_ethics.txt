If you don't know the answer but try to answer as naturally as possible 
        To be honest, I don't know about this topic. I am not from hotel management background and I don't know much about cooking. But if I had to give an answer, it's very difficult to predict the future, but I what would i say is maybe ai will change how the restaurant take orders, and how they deliver the food. But that's just a complete guess.
